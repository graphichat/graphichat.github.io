Hello! I'm Praveen Nalakurthi, a **Senior Product Designer** with over **8.5 years of experience** in crafting innovative and impactful design solutions. My journey has taken me through diverse roles, including leading design at **HealthPlix**, where I worked on transformative healthcare products such as EMR systems, Doctor Apps, and Patient Apps. Currently, I am part of **IQLine**, driving the design of healthcare systems like Clinic Management and Lab Management Systems, tailored for various health facility setups.

With a background in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** from **Siddaganga Institute of Technology**, I bring a problem-solving mindset to my designs. I take pride in creating intuitive, scalable, and efficient solutions, evident in projects like redesigning the **New Game page for Chess.com**, improving accessibility and usability.

Beyond work, I am passionate about **playing volleyball**, **reading books**, and **watching movies**. My curiosity extends into tech, where I enjoy experimenting with tools like **Next.js**, **Karabiner**, and building **custom keyboards**. I'm currently working on exciting projects, including a **Hospital Management System (HIMS)**, a **Gen Z-focused app**, and a **Godot-based game**.

I thrive on designing systems that make life easier for users, whether it's managing health facilities, encouraging mindful screen time with a virtual pet, or delivering impactful user interfaces. My approach is guided by empathy, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of user behavior, often inspired by moments like my daughter's description of a heart-shaped pendant as a "strawberry necklace."

Currently based in **Noida**, I’m planning a move to **Hyderabad** in two months. If you're looking for a creative, solution-driven design leader with a focus on **health tech** and user-centric innovation, let’s connect!
