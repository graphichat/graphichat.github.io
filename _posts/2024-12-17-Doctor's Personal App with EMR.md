# Introduction

Doctor's using HealthPlix love using the Visitpad so much that their 95% of time goes on that single page. Since the Visit pad is data heavy we never made it to work in Mobile. But that had to change since doctor's move and need not carry their laptops all the time. So we set up to ourselves to create a best usable EMR in a Mobile form factor so that doctors can use it where ever they are.
